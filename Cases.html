      <h2>COUNTERMAN v. COLORADO (2023) United States Supreme Court</h2>
      <p>
        From 2014 to 2016, Billy Counterman sent numerous Facebook messages to a
        local singer, C. W., despite her attempts to block him, causing her
        significant distress with some messages alluding to violence. C. W.'s
        fear led to changes in her daily routine and professional life,
        prompting her to involve the authorities. Counterman's appeal against
        his conviction under a Colorado statute was rejected by both the trial
        court and the Colorado Court of Appeals, as they found his messages
        objectively threatening regardless of his awareness of their impact, a
        decision upheld by the Colorado Supreme Court.
